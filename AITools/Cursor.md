# MCP(Model Context Protocol): is an open protocol that standardizes how applications
## 1. Provide context to LLMs(Large Language Models). Thinks of MCP like a USB-C Port for AI Applications.
## 2. MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI modesl to different data sources and tools. 
## 3. MCP enables you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs and connect your models with the world.

Cursor:  (ship faster, safer, and more maintainable code)
    1. Cursor Rules in files( Project-Specific instructions)
        cursor/rules.json
    2. Pre-Prompt(Cursor setting -> rules for AI)
    3. Close Unnecessary files only open needed files in context (@cursor-context)
    4. Watching AI coding, ask for explanations
    5. Add Some Logs in Key point Statement
    6. Testing (unit test(Jest, vitest) End-To-End test (Cypress))
    7. Code Review
    8. Security Check (audit)
